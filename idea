Build a Lofi radio kinda like lofi cafe. Cruise through different channels and find
find different beats to study/work/game to. 

Needs
----------
- A chill background - Definitely thinking pixel art
- Radio stations to cycle through - Which ones? Somehow make my own or do I 
have to get permission to use them? 
- A bar showing controls, song name, art, etc. - A nice feature that allows you to better
see the music you're listening to. 
- Sound effects - Calming, soothing sound effects like rain, driving, public noises, cars, 
people, etc. 
- A way to save music you know and like - It'd be nice to save the songs you've listened to if you want to go back
and play it again. 
- Show number of listeners - Fun way to show others that people are listening. 
- Send a random nice letter - Something taken from Kind Words. Give the option to send a nice letter to somoene. 
The letters will be pre-selected words to discourage others from sending something hateful.
